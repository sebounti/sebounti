# About Me

Hello ! My name is SÃ©bastien Lenne and I'm currently retraining for a career in the wonderful world of full stack development at Holberton School Lille, where I'm learning to speak the language of computers fluently. I've been fascinated by digital technology since I was a teenager.

After a ten-year adventure in the medical-social sector as an educator, where I honed my superpowers of empathy and creative problem-solving, I decided it was time to realise my childhood dream: to become a developer.

My actual quest? To explore the far reaches of the digital universe, one programming language and framework at a time, to create exceptional user experiences. Every day is a new adventure, with mysterious bugs to work out and eureka moments worth all the gold in the world.

Some people would say that moving from special education to web development is a radical change, but I prefer to think of it as moving from the art of cultivating minds to the art of cultivating code. And who knows? Maybe one day I'll develop an application that will make a small contribution to a better world, or at least one that will make someone smile as broadly as I do when I manage to get a piece of code to work without having to consult Stack Overflow.

### Why a web developer and not a Jedi?

Well, given that my waistline is closer to that of Jabba the Hutt than that of a well-trained Jedi, I decided that wielding a keyboard was more within my grasp than wielding a lightsaber! Plus, as a web developer, I can create cooler user interfaces than any Star Wars hologram. Plus, let's be honest, the idea of having R2-D2 as my coding assistant is a lot more tempting than having to put up with C-3PO's complaints all day. So, may the power of code be with me, because I'm going to build websites that will delight even the most demanding Ewoks! ðŸŒŸðŸ’»
